# cleanproject

**CRUD**

This is an adaptation of the CRUD project using vue Cli , where vue scafold the project structures and add modules necessary for a production level.

**The Problems**

Comunication betwen components is trick the emit is triggering the other components.

**Working ON**
The requests are working normaly, POST and GET but some type of CORS policy is on the way, I think thats what not letting my response from axios populate my array, returning an empty array on the vue instance.
